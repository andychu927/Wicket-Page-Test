This lightweight library allows you to unit test Wicket pages easily: It launches Jetty to run 
your webapp in-process and launches the Selenium 2.0 webdriver. Then you inject POJO mock objects 
into @SpringBean annotated fields (or @Inject if you use Guice) and use the webdriver to drive 
your page.
